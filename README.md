**Football Season Simulator**

This application generates a season schedule using an approximation of NFL league rules. It then allows simulation of the season using the schedule,preconfigured power levels for the teams in the league and a measure of random chance. The results are displayed week-by-week,
then summarized at the end of the season. After each week, a team can be searched for and their current record and standings are shown, along with their schedule.

At the end of the season, the playoffs bracket can be viewed, and the playoffs are then simulated as well up until the Super Bowl.
